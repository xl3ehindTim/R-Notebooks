Not to mention, that depending on the country you (your IP) currently are, the subtitle selection changes, just like how available movies change from country to country. So when I use my Dutch accounts to stream in my home country, I am not able to use the same subtitles that are available in the Netherlands. This prohibits me from being able to have a comfortable experience for all viewers, since we need to find (and usually do not find) a movie that has subtitles in my language, is interesting, and is on any of the above services. And that does not easily happen.

- Equal streaming from device to device: One of the biggest problems for me is the fact that most services provide a lackluster experience when you are not using them on either a smartphone or a smart TV. If you are not using either the Android or Apple applications, it means you are using a web browser. When you view content from (almost, there are some exceptions) all video streaming platforms, on a browser, they will limit your use to usually 1080p video with no Dolby Atmos, or HDR support, which is absolutely unacceptable. As a student, I use my PC as a TV as well, since my monitor is big enough and my room is small enough. Watching modern titles on 1080p for a big monetary premium such as the one on Netflix or Disney+ is absolutely unacceptable. And not only that, the sound experience is terrible, even if you do own a Dolby Atmos-supported audio playback device, since you are only allowed to have stereo and not surround sound. And also, let's not even mention the problem with HDR, which in movies of the 2020s makes all the difference. 

- High Compression Rate: Because of the client-server model, and streaming platforms being unable to serve the exponentially higher 4K 60FPS bandwidth, all streamed movies must go through an extensive compression algorithm. While compression algorithms are still one of the most highly-researched topics in Computer Science, compression still takes away from the experience of the movie, especially during dark-lit scenes. Optimally, the solution created will either have a low compression rate, or NO compression rate, so that users are allowed to receive what they paid for in its entirety, and not notice compression at every step of the way."
